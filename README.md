# The Temporal and Sectoral Effects of Federal Funds Rate Changes on U.S. Employment: A Multi-Industry Analysis (1990–2024)

**Authors:** Tianhuiqi Chen, Jinmin (Lexie) Li  
**Last updated:** 2024-12-20

## Overview
This repository contains the materials for our study on how changes in the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) transmit to U.S. employment **over time** and **across industries** from 1990–2024. We quantify dynamic responses with an event-study design and **local projections (Jordà)**, highlighting heterogeneity across sectors (e.g., interest-sensitive vs. less sensitive industries) and the timing of effects (months after shocks).

**What you’ll find here**
- A reproducible **Stata pipeline** that generates all tables and figures used in the paper and appendix.
- A **manuscript** with key results and a compact **appendix** with robustness and supporting analyses.
- A clear **replication guide** and **code index** mapping outputs to scripts.

> **Data note:** Raw or licensed datasets are **not** distributed here. We provide instructions to obtain them and maintain the exact directory structure for seamless replication.

## Repository Structure

├─ Manuscript/ # Main paper (PDF), figures, and summary files (.xlsx, .gph) \
├─ Replication Code/ # An overall Stata .do file to reproduce paper + appendix results  \
├─ Results/ # Auto-generated outputs: tables (.tex/.csv/.doc) and figures (.png/.pdf/.gph)  \
└─ README.md

## Software & Requirements
- **Stata:** Stata/MP 16.0 (16+ should work).  
- **Suggested user-written packages (if used in your scripts):**
  ```stata
  ssc install reghdfe, replace
  ssc install ftools, replace
  ssc install estout, replace
  ssc install outreg2, replace

## Replication Instructions

1. Download the repository
  Clone or download and keep the folder structure unchanged.

2. Set your working directory in Stata
  ```
  cd "[path_to_repo_root]"
  ```
3. Place required data
  Obtain raw data from the sources referenced in the Manuscript/Appendix (e.g., FFR/shock measures, employment series).
  Keep file names/locations as expected by the scripts (see comments inside .do files).

4. Run the scripts
  Navigate to Replication Code/ and run the relevant .do files.

  Full replication: run the master script if provided (e.g., final_project_mth_finalized.do) to reproduce all outputs.

  Targeted replication: run module-specific .do files for a single table/figure.

5. Outputs
  All artifacts are written to Results/, organized by Tables/ and Figures/ where applicable.
  
## Code Index (Tables & Figures → Scripts → Output Files)

### Tables

**Table 1** — generated by final_project_mth_finalized.do
  Output: table2_1_employment_lagged_fedfunds_correlations.xlsx

**Table 2** — generated by final_project_mth_finalized.do
  Output: table3_1_yearly_industry_employment.xlsx

**Table 3** — generated by final_project_mth_finalized.do
  Output: table_3_2_industry_sensitivity.xlsx

**Table 4** — generated by final_project_mth_finalized.do
Output: table4_1_industry_income_analysis.xlsx

**Table 5** — generated by final_project_mth_finalized.do
  Output: table4_2_industry _income_analysis.xlsx

**Table 6** — generated by final_project_mth_finalized.do
  Output: table4_3_industry_sensitivity.xlsx

### Figures

**Figure 1**— generated by final_project_mth_finalized.do
  Output: figure2_2_1_employment_fedfunds_hike_periods.png

**Figure 2** — generated by final_project_mth_finalized.do
  Output: figure2_2_2_employment_fedfunds_hike_periods.png

**Figure 3.1** — generated by final_project_mth_finalized.do
  Output: figure3_1_employment_trends.png

**Figure 3.2** — generated by final_project_mth_finalized.do
  Output: figure3_1_supply_employment_trends_seperate.png

**Figure 4** — Income Distribution Across Sectors
  Output: figure4_1_income_distribution.png

If you keep a single master script (e.g., final_project_mth_finalized.do) that orchestrates all steps (data prep → estimation → export), reference it at the top of each section with clear comments.
Data & Reuse

## Data availability: 
Raw/licensed inputs are not hosted here; see the Manuscript/Appendix for exact sources and access instructions.

Results: Key outputs necessary to understand findings (tables/figures) are included in Results/.

Reproducibility: With access to the original data and Stata 16+, all results can be regenerated via the provided .do files.
